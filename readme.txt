A WordPress plugin to load blocks and sections asynchronously. 
 
== Description ==
 
= Loads Posts and Gutenberg Patterns inside a loaded web page asynchronously and reduce page loading time significantly! =

This plugin presents a Gutenberg block that Loads content of supported post types via Ajax after page loads, very usefull for achieving lower load times, specially when there are dynamic contents.
 
= ðŸŒŸ Insert your 'Wordpress Blog Posts' or 'Gutenberg Patterns' anywhere inside your page =
- In Gutenberg editor, search for 'Ajax Sections' block and insert it inside your page or post layout
- Setup the options and parameters of the block on the side panel including post id or slug
- Choose either automatic asynchrounous loading of the post or pattern after a predefined delay or loading by clicking on a button
- Even turn off asynchronous loading and the post or pattern will load among other page elements normally
- Only one post or gutenberg pattern may be inserted in each page or post via gutenberg 'Ajax Sections' block using free version of this plugin
- You can insert as many blocks as you want in the gutenberg editor and you can see the resulting loaded post or pattern, but only the first block will be loaded at frontend while using free version
- Only the post or pattern main content will be loaded and other information like author, date, ... will not be shown
- Therefore the post or pattern should have a defined content in order to be loaded via this plugin
 
= ðŸ”¥ Unlock All Features with Ajax Sections Pro by Radaplug =
- Pro version also supports inserting 'Elementor Templates' inside your gutenberg page or post editor
- An 'Elementor Widget' will do the same as the 'Gutenberg Block' in any elementor editing page as well
- The 'Elementor Widget' also supports 'Wordpress Blog Posts' and 'Gutenberg Patterns' to be inserted in elementor pages
- Some 'Motion Effects' features are also available in both editors while loading a section or a block asynchronously
- There are no more limitations on the number of sections or blocks in any page or post
- Nested Sections or Blocks is also supported and if a post or pattern or elementor template contains an 'Ajax Sections' element itself, it will be loaded using its own settings too
- Some 'Elementor Templates' (e.g. Carousels) may require loading more javascript code to work properly and this will be handled in future versions of the pro plugin

= ðŸš€ Accelerate Your Website Pages but Avoid Layout Shift =
- By using this plugin you will gain more initial speed while loading your webpage by asynchronously loading contentful blocks or sections which may also require more time consuming database queries
- Asynchronous loading of blocks and sections may cause some Layout Shifts in the already loaded viewport of the page which is better to avoid
- If this is an important webpage which should have a high performance score (e.g Home Page or a Landing Page), you would rather not inserting an 'Ajax Sections' block or widget in the viewport of the page
